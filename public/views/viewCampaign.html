                <p>6 - Typically fits just right</p>

                <p><b>What was your initial impression of the clothes?</b><br />
                The dress is adorable, my daughter loves it!</p>

                <p><b>What did you think of the quality of the fabric and sewing?</b><br />
                    The quality is great! Even after multiple washings the colors are bright.</p>

                <p><b>How did the product fit? Was it too loose or too tight? Was it too long or too short? Are the arm, neck and leg openings big enough?</b><br />
                    Overall the fit is great.  The neck was a little tight when taking on and off.</p>

                    a. Purchase from The Patchery: Very likely<br/>
                    b. Recommend The Patchery to a friend: Definitely will</p>

                    I love all the fabric options!</p>
