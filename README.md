This app allows people to sign up to be volunteers to test their products (clothes). Users first signs in through 
facebook oAuth to become a willing volunteer and adds information like address, and sizes...etc. Before the users
can sign up, the Admin will have created a campaign listing so that all the people that sign up can sign up 
speicically for that campaign. Once the volunteers are in, the admin will create a list. The admin will have to chose
what sizes he or she wants to include on this test. One person is needed for each size. Using a random generator,
the app will go through all of the volunteers who signed up, pick one random person according to sizes needed and 
select them to be on the "accepted tester" list. If the admin wants to re-generate a new list for whatever reason, 
he or she may. Once the admin is content with the users selected, he or she will accept the new list, this finilazing
the Testers for this specific campaign. From the, the selected testers will need to upload photos of their person 
trying on the clothes and fill out a survey about how the clothes fit and so on. The admin then has an accordian 
style view to all the testers and their surveys filled out, organized by campaign.
